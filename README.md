Project Title: Eye Movement Exercise
Description: This is a project in which the user will be able to see a pair of eyes follow the cursor movement. CSS creates the styling of the page, JS is used for the movement of the pupils.
Plans: I plan on creating divs that pop up when the cursor hits certain areas of the screen. These pop ups will provide insightful quotes.
